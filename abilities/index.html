The exact form this protection takes could be anything, whether it&#39;s a reinforced combat suit, a high-tech force field, or just a really thick hide. For every Level you have in <em>Armored</em>, you may reduce the Damage Multiplier of any attack made to you by 1.

Your remarkable good looks tend to draw the attention of those around you and certainly make it easier to excel in jobs that require it, convince others to do as you like, and be sufficiently distracting when you want to be.

                <p class="item-text">You have made a variety of contacts that you can call upon for favors. Perhaps they can obtain goods normally not in your reach or get you in places you could not normally get into. At Level 1, you know a guy who knows a guy, and they might be able to get you a discount or let you into a semi-private club. At Level 2, you have a friend who you can consistently rely on. You may have a supplier who can get you rare parts for your creations, an informant who can give you news about a certain subject or organization, or a skilled craftsman who can lend their talents. At Level 3, you know a variety of people in a small circle who can help you achieve what you want or have a friend with a wide breadth of uses. Though restricted to a particular field, you may have access to all of the previous examples at once. At Level 4, you have a vast assortment of contacts who owe you favors or are otherwise willing to aid you. Though it may take time, you can always find someone to help you with what you need. At Level 5, you are in with nearly everyone. No matter where you go, someone owes you something, and you can reasonably expect to cash in on a favor in any situation.</p>

In addition to being an easy target for cheek pinches, many find it hard to be angry, mean, or in any way aggressive towards you. On the flip side, you might also be hard to take seriously. You may add your <em>Cute!</em> dice whenever you wish to abuse your cuteness to get something you want, to persuade those you&#39;ve angered from taking their aggression out on you (or anyone else), or to simply put on the charm.</p>

It could be a personal capacity of adrenaline, a swig from your trusty flask, or something else with limits. Although having this extra Endurance is useful, unlike real Endurance, it cannot be spent for stamina-related tasks or to receive Drama Dice. It cannot be recovered in combat, nor is it automatically restored by a short rest. Endurance for this item can only be regained after a length of time, such as through recharging over a 24 hour period. Also, Endurance Reserve cannot be used for Damage taken in combat. If the character&#39;s own Health and Endurance is reduced to zero, they still fall unconscious, regardless of the amount of Endurance remaining in the item.</p>

At Level 2, you are recognized in your field, and those familiar with your work or history will be thrilled to meet you in person. At Level 3, you are well known in many venues and can often cash in on your fame for a favor, accommodations, or other perks. At Level 4, you are world famous with countless adoring fans. You can expect the red carpet rolled out for you wherever you go and are treated to luxuries, favors, and amenities befitting your status. At Level 5, you are a legend.

It may be a power suit built to increase your strength and toughness, a magical sword that grants you mystical power, or a customizable mechanical arm with an array of special effects. While you might consistently have access to this <em>Gear</em>, you are not required to use it all the time. Nor is its availability guaranteed, as it can also be lost, broken, or taken from you. For every Level that you have in <em>Gear</em>, you may spend an equal number of Levels to craft it from other Abilities. You may also choose Weaknesses to increase the number of Levels available to your <em>Gear</em>.

                <p class="item-text">You have the remarkable skill to heal others from even the worst injuries. You might have some special power, divine influence, or just a really big box of bandages. Simply roll your <em>Healer</em> dice; the result is the amount of Health recovered. This task takes significant concentration and generally cannot be done in combat or when your attention is otherwise diverted. If others safeguard and protect your efforts, you can complete the action in a Round. However, if you make any other rolls, even a Defense Roll, the effort is aborted, and you must try again. If a full Round passes without intervention, you succeed and the appropriate Health is regained. Characters knocked unconscious can be brought around through restoring their Health above zero. Only so much can be done for any injury in a given day, and an amount of time determined by the Game Master must pass before any single character may be healed again.</p>

                <p class="item-text">You have a natural talent for creating machines and gadgets to serve a myriad of purposes. However, attempts to build these things are not automatically successful. You must roll your Inventor dice (as well as any other Abilities that apply, like Smart) and compare it to the Difficulty Number appropriate to the complexity of your invention. Some inventions might also require special parts and long periods of time to build at the Game Master&#39;s discretion. These inventions may also mimic other Abilities and Weaknesses. Compare the total (Abilities minus Weaknesses) to discover their complexity. Failed attempts produce nothing of value or something that will break (or explode) later on. New characters may start play with one or more inventions of complexity equal to their Ability in <em>Inventor</em>. For example, a character with +4 in Inventor may start with a Modern Marvel.</p>

At Level 2, long-winded conversations go over your head completely. You have a hard time following instructions, and only the most overt attempts at with will successfully be conveyed to you. At Level 3, you have the attention span of a three-year-old but without the patience to sort building blocks by color. Almost nothing can be successfully discussed with you, and you totally miss the point of anything that&#39;s not a plainly stated fact.</p>
