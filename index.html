        <p>In the 1854th year of the Malbor Calendar, Porsculla would make the first move in the continental conflict known as the <em class="vocab">War of Borders</em>. Porcsulla's target was the coast to the south of Magnava, where they could establish ports in the warmer waters. Kasparak also had its eyes on the water access of Hevesta and Vospol, providing additional fronts for the war. Over the eight years of conflict, Magnava and Porsculla would develop radical scientific advancements in attempts to turn the tides of war in their favour. Magnava would invent the <em class="vocab">Titan Serum</em>, a chemical solution that would turn ordinary people into hulking soldiers with immense strength and endurance. Porsculla turned its attention to equipping their soldiers, and would produce a plethora of <em class="vocab">gadgets</em> that would give a common soldier a step up in a fight. Rocket-propelled explosives, grappling hooks, and infra-red tripwires would pour out of the porscullan factories to see prolific use on the battlefield. The coflicts would end in 1862 at the <em class="vocab">Conference of Zuvich</em> in Tovarich. The public war stopped there, but what arose from the ashes of the conflict was a cold war fought by intelligence agencies and counter-intelligence operatives on either side, waiting for the other to throw the first punch.</p>

        <h2>Here's where you come in</h2>
        <p>The year is 1871 of the Galvanic Era. It's been 9 years since the armistice, and the war has started to leave the public's attention. One way or another, you understand that there's much more going on beneath the surface than what the public is led to believe, and you use this knowledge to profit off of the intelligence agencies around you. You are a member of a crew of criminals, contract or otherwise, who undergo daring heists and operations for a number of reasons. Porsculla's the best stomping grounds for your work, but <em class="vocab">the Hawks</em>, Porsculla's agency of domestic affairs, keep a thorough tab on its citizens. In order to not be arrested under suspicion of conspiracy, <em class="vocab">you must take on a public facade</em> that you maintain while not on a job. This cover identity can be anything, so long as you can maintain it while taking jobs with your crew. Some jobs might even provide your crew with key information that you can exploit during a job. Whatever you do, <em class="threat">make sure that you can do it well</em>.</p>
